* My NixOS configuration

  [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] is an awesome Linux distribution that I'm using in my home
  machine with success. These files are my configuration for it, and
  it installs and configures all my applications and services.

** Using it

   You probably need to replace my ~hardware-config.nix~ with your own
   and adjust the ~configuration.nix~ to use your own video drivers.

   After that you need to create one symlink:

   #+begin_src sh
     sudo rm -rf /etc/nixos && sudo ln -s $PWD/global/nixos /etc/
   #+end_src

   Then you can run:

   #+begin_src sh
     ./apply-config
   #+end_src
