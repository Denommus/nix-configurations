* My NixOS configuration

  [[https://nixos.org/][NixOS]] is an awesome Linux distribution that I'm using in my home
  machine with success. These files are my configuration for it, and
  it installs and configures all my applications and services.

** Using it

   You probably need to replace my ~hardware-config.nix~ with your
   own.

   After that you need to create two symlinks:

   #+begin_src sh
     sudo rm -rf /etc/nixos && sudo ln -s $PWD/global/nixos /etc/
     rm -rf $HOME/.config/nixpkgs && ln -s $PWD/home/nixpkgs $HOME/.config/
   #+end_src

   Then you can run:

   #+begin_src sh
     ./apply-config
   #+end_src
