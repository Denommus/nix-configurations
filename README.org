* My NixOS configuration

** Disclaimer

   This is probably not fit for intellectual property rights, because
   as of now it's too simple. But I'll probably have my own custom
   packages in the future here, so just in case I'm adding a MIT
   license.

** Using it

   You probably need to replace my ~hardware-config.nix~ with your
   own.

   After that you need to create two symlinks:

   #+begin_src sh
     sudo rm -rf /etc/nixos && sudo ln -s $PWD/global/nixos /etc/
     rm -rf $HOME/.config/nixpkgs && ln -s $PWD/home/nixpkgs $HOME/.config/
   #+end_src

   Then you can run:

   #+begin_src sh
     ./apply-config
   #+end_src
